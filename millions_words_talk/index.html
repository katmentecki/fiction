# Overview


- ### Emergence of Horror as a Genre

- ### Computational Approaches to Genre Classification

- ### Underwood's "The Life Cycles of Genres"

- ### Areas for Follow Up and Expansion

- ### What I've Done So Far

- ### Preliminary Results / Lessons Learned

- ### Emerging Questions

- ### Next Steps

---

# Emergence of Horror as a Genre

- ### Gothic
- ### Victorian ghost story
- ### Weird fiction and supernatural horror
- ### Horror fiction after the rise of Hollywood

---

# Computational Approaches to Genre Classification

- ### Are genres fundamentally historical categories, or are there narrative continuities that define and characterize them?
- ### To what degree are historical and textual elements intertwined? Computational methods uniquely situated to address (Underwood)
- ### Are horror and the Gothic a unified genre, cyclical, generational? (Moretti)
- ### How does literary diction change over time? (Underwood and Sellers)
- ### Can machine learning approaches aid processes of genre classification?

---

# Underwood's "The Life Cycles of Genres"

- ### Dataset of 950+ works of fiction from 1750 to 1989
- ### Metadata and term frequency tables
- ### Genre tags for "detective," "sci-fi," "Gothic," and "random"
- ### Supervised learning approach
- ### Series of binary-assigned logistic regression tests (i.e. "crime" vs. "not crime")
- ### Compared accuracy of various genre predictions
- ### Found more continuity/predictability in the detective genre than in Gothic or science fiction.
- ### Full data available on [Github](https://github.com/tedunderwood/fiction)

---

# Areas for Follow Up and Expansion

- ### Thinking about horror as owing a debt to a small subset of the Gothic
- ### Horror subgenres
- ### Unsupervised learning (especially clustering)
- ### Influence of multi-genre classification system
- ### Controlling for a text's date signal
- ### Corpus Development: Is there a missing link between 1860 and 1930?

---

# What I've Done So Far

- ### Forked repo in [Github](https://github.com/mjlavin80/fiction) to Document Experiments
- ### Various unsupervised methods using Python's Scikit Learn
- ### Hand-tagged gothic subgenres in corpus, including
<code>
  ghost-haunting

  monster

  killer-slasher-gore

  demon-occult-witch-magic-psychic

  insanity-deranged
</code>
- ### Exploratory analysis of features correlated with date and genre
- ### Experimented with iterating over flat files, mysql database, and pickled data (.p files)

---

# Preliminary Results

- ### Confusion matrices
- ### Features correlated with date and genre

---

# Lessons Learned

- ### Numerous steps can be pre-processed and stored
- ### Cost-benefit analysis of optimization changes at scale
- ### More Performant Code = More Time to Do Tests and Analyze
- ### Feature dictionaries are most performant
- ### Sklearn pipe feature with pickled data (built from db) is fastest and most portable
- ### Haven't tried going straight from flat file to .p data
- ### Interested in other key-value store approaches

---
# Emerging Questions
- ### If a machine learning model is highly accurate but based on very few terms, have we learned anything?
- ### Do date signals affect some genres' continuity more than others?
- ### Can unsupervised clusters be applied as training data to a horror dataset to better classify subgenres?
- ### To what degree do these approaches tell us about cataloging practices over time?
- ### How do we grow a horror corpus to best represent the genre's rich history and many subgenres?
- ### How do we unlock the potential of analogue bibliographies and refrence guides to inform large-scale DH?

---

# Next Steps

- ### Logistic regression using additional feature selection methods
 - ### By removing top N features most correlated with date
 - ### BY selecting only top N features correlated with genre
- ### Multi-label and multi-class machine learning
- ### Expansion of gothic and horror corpus
- ### Next Spring: First Experiences in Research program
 - ### Three undergrads working on "Gothic and Horror Bibliography"
- ### Better visualizations for unsupervised learning results?
